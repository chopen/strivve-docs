# Credit card issuance doesn’t end at activation.

When you implement card provisioning services via the CardSavr API you will need to integrate with other 
applications. Although each integration scenario is unique, there are common requirements and issues that 
developers and product teams must consider.

This section provides background and guidance on the areas that must be considered when integrating the CardSavr API
into your solution. Each area describes the design and decision considerations for a particular scenario rather than 
a specific implementation. 

 
In this section you’ll find:
* An overview of the CardSavr platform
* A primer on the platform architecture
* Best practices and design considerations for:
    * Credential management
    * Data retention
    * PCI compliance
    * User interface and experience
