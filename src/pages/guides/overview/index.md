# Strivve Platform

Strivveâ€™s CardSavr Service is a Software As A Service (SaaS) which securely places payment cards on merchant sites on 
behalf of Card Issuers and their cardholders. It uses Remote Process Automation (RPA) to perform these push-provisioning
operations.  CardSavr is PCI-DSS compliant.  

### Development Processes
The CardSavr service supports your development model with multple environments for each phase of development.  For 
 example; sandbox, dev, and production environments are configurable. For testing, non-production environments are 
 equipped with synthetic sites allowing you to test without impacting live merchant sites.
