CardSavr environments can be configured to work with tools such as Postman, curl, etc.  A Postman template collection of requests is available along with usage instructions at GitHub for the [Strive-SDK](https://github.com/swch/Strivve-SDK/tree/master/postman-samples "Strivve-SDK") to aide in exploring the CardSavr API.

## Postman is good for...

- Exploring the CardSavr REST API
- Experimenting with a CardSavr REST API endpoint before incorporating in a application.
