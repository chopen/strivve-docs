# Strivve-SDK

This library is an implementation of the CardSavr API for Node.js or web applications. It contains methods for session management; security and cryptography; and resource retrieval, creation, updating, and deleting. By mangaging CardSavr's complex security requirements automatically, the JavaScript library greatly simplifies the implementation of CardSavr in your own app.

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Please note: most methods in this library are asynchronous and therefore return resolved promises. Each method's individual documentation will specify if it is asynchronous.  Take a look at the Quick Start guide to get up and running with the CardSavr library.</div>
