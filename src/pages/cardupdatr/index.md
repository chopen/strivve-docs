While CardUdatr can operate as a stand-alone web application in most implementations you will want 
to host the CardUpdatr application within your existing web site. There are two options when 
hosting (embedding) CardUpdatr within your existing website:

1.	***Embedded*** --- The easiest method is utilizing an iFrame within your existing website to host 
the CardUpdatr application.  This is done simply by adding 10 lines of code to your site. When embedded, CardUpdatr 
will automatically hide the banner images and terms of service page seen on the stand-alone version of CardUpdatr.  
This is done to seamlessly blend into your existing brand.

2.	***Single Sign On*** --- While this option does require deeper technical integration it provides the best user 
experience because the user is authenticated by your website before using CardUpdatr application. When the user 
is authenticated, your site passes the card and address information directly to CardUpdatr removing the manual 
entry required on the other versions of CardUpdatr.
