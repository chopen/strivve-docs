While CardUdatr can operate as a stand-alone web application in most implementations you will want 
to host the CardUpdatr application within your existing web site. There are two options when 
hosting (embedding) CardUpdatr within your existing website:

1.	__Embedded__ --- The easiest method is utilizing an iFrame within your existing site or application to host 
the CardUpdatr functionality.  This is done simply by adding 10 lines of code to your site. When embedded, CardUpdatr 
will automatically hide the banner images and terms of service page seen on the stand-alone version of CardUpdatr. These
items are removed to seamlessly blend the CardUpdatr application into your existing brand.

2.	__Single Sign On__ --- While this option does require deeper technical integration it provides a much better user 
experience because the user is authenticated by your website before CardUpdatr use within your application. When the user 
is authenticated, your site or application passes the cardholder card details and cardholder address information directly to CardUpdatr removing the manual entry by the cardholder.
